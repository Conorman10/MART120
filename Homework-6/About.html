            “Lamb to the Slaughter” is a dark short story about a pregnant woman named Mary Maloney, a seemingly happy and devoted wife who unexpectedly kills her husband, Patrick, with the frozen leg of a lamb. Despite being pregnant, Mary doesn't feel remorse for her actions and quickly devises a plan to avoid suspicion. First, she creates an alibi by interacting with a grocer named Sam and then acts shocked when she discovers her dead husband in Sam’s presence. Next, Mary invites the investigative officers to her house and cooks the lamb for them, which the officers eat without knowing they are eating the murder weapon. During this time, Mary ironically comments that the murder weapon could be “right under their noses”. The story ends with Mary silently giggling at the irony of the situation. The story is a sick and twisted tale that exemplifies themes of betrayal, revenge, and irony while also highlighting Roald Dahl’s storytelling ability as an author.
