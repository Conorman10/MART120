                “Lamb to the Slaughter” is a dark short story about a pregnant woman named Mary Maloney, a seemingly happy and devoted wife who unexpectedly kills her husband, Patrick, with the frozen leg of a lamb. <br>
                Despite being pregnant, Mary doesn't feel remorse for her actions and quickly devises a plan to avoid suspicion. <br>
                First, she creates an alibi by interacting with a grocer named Sam and then acts shocked when she discovers her dead husband in Sam's presence. <br> 
                Next, Mary invites the investigative officers to her house and cooks the lamb for them, which the officers eat without knowing they are eating the murder weapon. <br>
                During this time, Mary ironically comments that the murder weapon could be “right under their noses”. <br>
                The story ends with Mary silently giggling at the irony of the situation. <br>
                The story is a sick and twisted tale that exemplifies themes of betrayal, revenge, and irony while also highlighting Roald Dahl’s storytelling ability as an author.
